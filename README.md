Being in a region where Telegram is blocked can be really frustrating, especially when you need it for work or staying in touch with friends. Luckily, using a proxy can help you bypass these restrictions effortlessly.

[Start now with 9Proxy](https://9proxyofficial.short.gy/home-github-james2k4) and access Telegram from anywhere!

Hereâ€™s how it works: A proxy hides your real IP address and makes it appear like you're accessing Telegram from a different locationâ€”one where itâ€™s not blocked. Just choose a proxy, set it up on your device, and youâ€™re good to go. Telegram will feel like itâ€™s available everywhere.
